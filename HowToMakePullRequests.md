# How to Make Pull Requests

This guide will walk you through the process of making a pull request (PR) on GitHub. Follow these steps to contribute to the repository!

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Go to the [repository's GitHub page](https://github.com/mrandrewandrade/ter).
2. Click the **Fork** button in the upper-right corner of the page to create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Next, clone your fork to your local machine:

1. Open a terminal on your computer.
2. Run the following command (replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ter.git
    ```

3. Navigate into the repository:
    ```bash
    cd ter
    ```

## Step 3: Create a New Branch

To avoid making changes directly to the `main` branch, create a new branch:

1. In your terminal, run:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-changes
    ```
    Replace `my-changes` with a descriptive name for your branch.

## Step 4: Make Changes

Now, make changes to the files in the repository. 

You can also use GitHub's web editor to directly edit files.

## Step 5: Commit Your Changes

Once you've made the changes, commit them to your branch:

1. Stage your changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2. Commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
    ```

## Step 6: Push Your Changes

Push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin my-changes

## Step 7: Create The Request

Go to the forked repository, make sure you are on the other branch not the main one.

Now, click on the green Compare & Pull Request, make sure the base repository is mrandrewandrade/ter and the base branch is main.

Now, click Create Pull Request.
